# ðŸ“‚ About the Data
The data used in this project was scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). It includes regular season statistics for every NBA team from the 2000 to 2024 seasons, covering:

- Basic offensive and defensive statistics (e.g., points per game, turnovers)

- Advanced statistics (e.g., Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, Net Rating)

These statistics were then merged with playoff outcome data, including:

- Playoff seed

- Number of playoff series wins

- Championship outcome (binary: Champion or Not)

The final dataset is available as a .csv file and included in this repository.
