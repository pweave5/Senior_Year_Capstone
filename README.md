# üèÄ Predicting NBA Playoff Success Using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict how much postseason success an NBA team will have based off their regular season preformance. It was developed as a senior undergraduate project focused on sports analytics, statistical modeling, and data-driven prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Summary
This project was built from the ground up. No suitable dataset was found for my specific use case, so I built one with the help of web scraping. The dataset was then used to conduct some EDA, with a goal of identifying helpful predictors of the next NBA Champion. Then, the modeling began. A variety of models were created, but the final model was a stacked ensemble model of a MLR, Random Forest, and Neural Network. This model achieved an RMSE of 3.55 games and an R-Squared of 0.70 on the test set. Another point of interest is that the model outcomes closely matched the betting odds of some sports betting organizations. All of the process and results are fully explained in the final paper available at (Final Paper)[].

## üöÄ Future Improvements and Projects
- Incoporate team playoff experience (e.g., past appearances, veteran presence)
- Implement classification models
    - Predict whether a team will win a head-to-head playoff series

    - Predict championship likelihood
