# 🏀 Predicting NBA Playoff Success Using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict how much postseason success an NBA team will have based off their regular season preformance. It was developed as a senior undergraduate project focused on sports analytics, statistical modeling, and data-driven prediction.

## 📂 About the Data
The data used in this project was scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). It includes the regular season statistics for every NBA team from the 2000-2024 The data used in this project was scraped from Basketball Reference. It includes regular season statistics for every NBA team from the 2000 to 2024 seasons, covering:

- Basic statistics (e.g., points per game, turnovers)

- Advanced statistics (e.g., Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, Net Rating)

These statistics were then merged with playoff outcome data, including:

- Playoff seed

- Number of playoff series wins

- Championship outcome (binary: Champion or Not)

The final dataset is available as a .csv file and included in this repository.

## 🛠️ Project Summary

## 🚀 Future Improvements and Projects
- Incoporate team playoff experience (e.g., past appearances, veteran presence)
- Implement classification models
    - Predict whether a team will win a head-to-head playoff series

    - Predict championship likelihood
